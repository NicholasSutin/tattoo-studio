        <h1>Health Risks</h1>
        <p>Findings from a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00228-1/fulltext">case control study</a> trying to identify cases of malignant lymphoma associated with tattooed individuals suggests there is a 21% higher adjusted risk (not to be confused with a 21% chance) of overall lymphoma. This is because the carcinogenic chemicals in tattoo ink get deposited to the lymph nodes.<br>Despite this, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-tattoos-cause-lymphoma-202407193059">Harvard Health</a> suggests that the lack of a link between size or number of tattoos and having increased lymphoma risk works against the claim. Harvard also suggests that as the rate of tattoed individuals increases, lymphoma does not correlate closely enough.
        <br>However, Harvard does acknowledge other health risks, such as infections, viral hepatitus, allergic reactions, scarring, and skin cancer.</p>

        <h1>Statistics</h1>
        <p>According to <a href="https://pewrsr.ch/3QFg5w1">Pew Research Center</a>, nearly a third of Americans have a tattoo, with 22% having more than one.</p>
